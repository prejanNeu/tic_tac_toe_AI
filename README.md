# Tic-Tac-Toe Minimax Algorithm
* Overview 
This repository contains two Python scripts for a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with AI using the Minimax algorithm. The minimax.py script defines a board class with methods for game mechanics and the Minimax algorithm. The runner.py script demonstrates the usage of the board class for playing Tic-Tac-Toe against the AI.

`minimax.py`
The board class has methods for actions, game results, player determination, winner checking, terminal state detection, utility computation, and the Minimax algorithm.

`runner.py`
This script demonstrates how to use the board class to play Tic-Tac-Toe against the AI, which makes optimal moves using the Minimax algorithm.

Usage
- Run runner.py to play Tic-Tac-Toe against the AI.

- The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to determine its moves, aiming for optimal gameplay.

Note: The AI assumes a perfect opponent, ensuring either a win or a draw.
